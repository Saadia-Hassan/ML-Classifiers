# ML Classifiers
The pre-processing steps are worth looking at, for the beginners. In the world full of data, Machine Learning has become a to-go field for the ones looking to start off their career. This project shows basic operations performed on the dataset which is widely known as pre-processing. Once the data is ready, 3 main classifier algorithms are applied to find out the **Jaccard similarity, F1-score and Accuracy** which are the few important parameters one should look at while analysing a model.
